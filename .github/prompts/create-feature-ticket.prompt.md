# Context
I am a software developer working as the team lead of a cross-functional Scrum team.
I want to create well-defined tickets that can later be delegated to team members.

# System Description
The goal of the application is to provide an intuitive and efficient platform for managing and reserving shared workspace and parking resources across multiple office locations. The system supports different user roles and allows for flexible resource availability based on time and ownership. It aims to simplify the reservation process with a user-friendly interface, while offering administrators tools to manage and monitor resource usage effectively.

# Instructions
Based on the draft content I will provide, generate a ticket using the structure defined below.

At the end give me the ID of the ticket and also a direct link to the ticket.

# Tools
- Use your available tools to create the ticket in github.
- Use "Feature" tracker type when creating the ticket.


# Response format
Your response must include both the [Ticket name] and [Ticket content] sections using the structure below.
Only capitalize the first word in the ticketâ€™s name.

# Response definition
[Ticket name]  
Short, clear and descriptive title that summarizes the scope of the task at hand in one sentence.


[Ticket content]  
+User story:+ As a <user role>, I want to <do something> so that <benefit>.  

+Goal:+ 
Clearly define the goal of the task in one or two sentences. 
Use 'Goal' instead of 'User Story' for tickets that are not related to user-facing functionality but focus on technical tasks.


+Requirements:+
* List bullet-point requirements based on the draft content.
* Focus on what needs to be achieved, not how it should be done.
* Technical details are not required in this section.

+Implementation plan:+
* Guidence on how the requirements should be implemented.
